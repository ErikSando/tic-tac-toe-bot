Beginning (21/04/2025)

I think basic min-max will be enough considering how simple the game is
I'll start thinking about how I will represent the grid and how moves will work

Day 1 (21/04/2025) - starting programming

Created some basic functions for the game grid (print, setgrid)
Either print or setgrid are not working correctly, which I will look into later
